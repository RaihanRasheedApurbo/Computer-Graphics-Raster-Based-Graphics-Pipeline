# Computer-Graphics-Raster-Based-Graphics-Pipeline

In this project we create raster based graphics pipeline which is
used in openGL to simulate 2D/3D view. At the end of this pipeline
we have also produced a bmp image that gives us viewer's view of 
the 3D world from a given position and viewer's visual capability.

This project helps us to understand how game engine is built and how
various matrix operations is being done when rendering a image in computer
screen.

To run this project in vscode simply use cntrl+F5 after opening the pipeline.cpp 

You can also run this project from terminal using the shell script run.sh

To understand project specification read the pdf named Offline-2-Specifications-Complete.pdf. 

bmp_image_codes folder has the necessary files to create a bmp image given
frame matrix of an image.

Test Cases(Updated) folder has some test cases to test the implementation.
Description of the test cases can be understood from project specification.
